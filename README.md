- **`datasets/`**: Contains the raw data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) used for analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains the Python source code and scripts required to process the data and generate results.
- **`requirements.txt/`**: Contains the pandas library, used for analysis.

2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # For macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the root or scripts folder, install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
